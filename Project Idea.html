          <h3>Mealr</h3>
          <br />
          <h4>Roles</h4>
          <p>
            For every great app there needs to be organisation amongst the team designing 
            and creating it, with SOMMI we have stated earlier that our ideal jobs are quite 
            similar. We have future software designers, full stack developers and even a database specialist, 
            this makes it quite difficult to hand out specific roles as many suit that same 
            role. In saying that, it is important we have roles so the creation of this app 
            is successful. As Mitchell has been the group leader so far and his passion is to
            become a software developer it would only makes sense that he would be our lead 
            software developer, making sure the back end of Mealr runs correctly. He has 
            expressed before that he has some experience in coding as well, therefore it 
            would be best for SOMMI to have him as our lead software developer. Now considering
            the amount of code that would need to be constructed it would not be 
            appropriate for Mitchell to do this all on his own, this is where Isaac 
            would step in and help along the way. Isaac has expressed before that he
            would like to become a software developer in the future and Mealr would be 
            the perfect opportunity to work on his skills. The app is being developed for 
            both major smart phone operating systems and will have its own online 
            website, therefore the coding needed to complete Mealr is going to be 
            quite substantial. Isaac and Mitchell will certainly have their hands 
            full for their first programming role, however as Mealr’s creator Michael
            wants to be a senior developer in the future, he could also help them 
            in the coding process. Not only can Michael help code the app, but he 
            can also lead it correctly as Mealr was his vision after all, having 
            this role allows him to be the all-rounder of sorts, making sure the code 
            is correct and leading team members in the correct direction. Michael as the 
            senior developer makes sense as he will make sure the Mealr will become everything
            he wanted it to be and see that it reaches its fullest potential. Michael
            will be helping everywhere as he will know what’s the best direction for Mealr, 
            being the senior developer, he will also help on the front-end and considering 
            Olivia wants to become a full stack developer after university it would make sense 
            that she deals with the front-end coding of Mealr. Full stack developers typically 
            are proficient in both front and back-end coding, we already have two out of the 5 
            people focusing primarily on the back end so its important we have someone to deal with 
            the frontend. Olivia has already shown throughout her work within the 
            group that she is great at being organised, she has made sure that 
            everything is recorded and is there for everybody in the group to see. 
            When dealing with the front-end it is vital that we have Olivia managing 
            it as everything displayed to the user needs to be well presented and 
            organised. With every app there always needs to be constant tweaks and 
            updates to keep it running smoothly, that’s generally the role of a 
            database specialist, which luckily for us at SOMMI we have Shanice who 
            in the future would like to be a database specialist! We would need someone
            that is great at analytics and Shanice has mentioned previously how that is 
            a specialty she possesses. A major risk to every app is errors occurring or 
            bugs appearing that take gives the user a poor experience, a database specialist
            will make sure that they find bugs before they arise by constantly test the program,
            almost trying to make it crash. For an app as large as Mealr with be with its inventory
            Shanice’s role will be a critical one. All of these roles play a critical part in the creation
            of Mealr, every single member would need to play their part as if anyone doesn’t then this 
            application would never work correctly. Thankfully we in SOMMI work great together, therefore 
            Mealr has a very bright future!

          <h4>Risks</h4>
          <p>
            When making an application like mealr there are always going to
            be numerous risks involved. As mealr can be downloaded on iOS and android
            devices we expect it will be extremely popular therefore leading to 
            several bugs and glitches being found by the community. To identify 
            the possible risks Mealr faces we must look at the many different working
            parts that allow for this application to run correctly. Firstly, publishing 
            the application will be a risk as the programming side is an aspect that many 
            of us in SOMMI do not have much experience in. To develop Mealr we would need 
            a solid understanding of CSS, JavaScript, and HTML, we would also need knowledge
            in Java and Swift programming languages as we want the app to run on 
            all major smart phones. With our limited experience Mealr could be a buggy 
            app that is constantly glitching or even worse may just not work correctly 
            at all. This is risk is one possibly not all companies would face when starting
            an app, however for us doing this project, it’s a real risk we face 
            and the only way we could alleviate this risk is with us at SOMMI 
            learn and become proficient in multiple programming languages.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another risk is that this app relies on the incorporation of 
            supermarket companies, we would need a major supermarket chain
            agree with us so that we can use their products. Now we believe
            that supermarkets would love to be a part of Mealr as they would
            see it as only a positive for their company, however if they did not 
            like the project or simply found no interest in the app, then there 
            would lie a major problem as we would use their products, prices etc 
            to help the user shop for their recipes. Another possible risk regarding
            supermarket companies not wanting to partner up is the funding aspect. 
            Mealr is a free app that offers a paid subscription to the user for more 
            recipes, this is a great formula to begin a project however if not enough 
            people want to pay the monthly subscription, then the app would simply not make enough
            money to cover the expenses. If the supermarket companies are not willing to team up, 
            then the Mealr development team would not be able to pay off the loan that would be 
            needed to start the company and would not be able to continue running the company. 
            The biggest possible risk is the fact that a supermarket chain may 
            agree to partner up with Mealr, however midway through development 
            lose interest and decide not to continue the partnership. This would leave
            SOMMI in a horrible position as they would now be left with a loan to 
            pay off and the dream of running Mealr could die.
          </p>
          
            make sure it’s safe or permitted to consume. It’s hoped that Mealr
            can partner with supermarket and food stores to create a competitive
            market, ultimately benefitting the consumers by their freedom of
            choice.
