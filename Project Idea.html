          <h4>Brief</h4>
          <p>
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
            Our group’s project idea is an application called Mealr. Mealr can
            be downloaded onto any iOS or android device, as well as having a
            companion website, which allows users to organise their weekly meal
            planning and grocery shopping list all at the same time. Users of
            the Mealr and its website will be able to select from a range of
            different recipes that are released weekly by Mealr itself, as well
            as the users of Mealr. The user will also be able to filter the
            recipes they wish to cook for that week based on their dietary
            requirements or preferences. When the recipes for the week have been
            selected, Mealr will create a shopping list for the user and predict
            the estimated cost for that week’s meals depending on which
            supermarket they wish to visit. The aim for Mealr is to eliminate
            the need for users to think about what they are needing to cook for
            that week, eliminate the need to think about what they need to buy
            when creating their shopping list, and eliminating the need to read
            through each product’s ingredient list to ensure it’s appropriate or
            safe to cook with depending on the user’s dietary requirements.

=======
            For every great app there needs to be organisation amongst the team designing 
            and creating it, with SOMMI we have stated earlier that our ideal jobs are quite 
            similar. We have future software designers, full stack developers and even a database specialist, 
            this makes it quite difficult to hand out specific roles as many suit that same 
            role. In saying that, it is important we have roles so the creation of this app 
            is successful. As Mitchell has been the group leader so far and his passion is to
            become a software developer it would only makes sense that he would be our lead 
            software developer, making sure the back end of Mealr runs correctly. He has 
            expressed before that he has some experience in coding as well, therefore it 
            would be best for SOMMI to have him as our lead software developer. Now considering
            the amount of code that would need to be constructed it would not be 
            appropriate for Mitchell to do this all on his own, this is where Isaac 
            would step in and help along the way. Isaac has expressed before that he
            would like to become a software developer in the future and Mealr would be 
            the perfect opportunity to work on his skills. The app is being developed for 
            both major smart phone operating systems and will have its own online 
            website, therefore the coding needed to complete Mealr is going to be 
            quite substantial. Isaac and Mitchell will certainly have their hands 
            full for their first programming role, however as Mealr’s creator Michael
            wants to be a senior developer in the future, he could also help them 
            in the coding process. Not only can Michael help code the app, but he 
            can also lead it correctly as Mealr was his vision after all, having 
            this role allows him to be the all-rounder of sorts, making sure the code 
            is correct and leading team members in the correct direction. Michael as the 
            senior developer makes sense as he will make sure the Mealr will become everything
            he wanted it to be and see that it reaches its fullest potential. Michael
            will be helping everywhere as he will know what’s the best direction for Mealr, 
            being the senior developer, he will also help on the front-end and considering 
            Olivia wants to become a full stack developer after university it would make sense 
            that she deals with the front-end coding of Mealr. Full stack developers typically 
            are proficient in both front and back-end coding, we already have two out of the 5 
            people focusing primarily on the back end so its important we have someone to deal with 
            the frontend. Olivia has already shown throughout her work within the 
            group that she is great at being organised, she has made sure that 
            everything is recorded and is there for everybody in the group to see. 
            When dealing with the front-end it is vital that we have Olivia managing 
            it as everything displayed to the user needs to be well presented and 
            organised. With every app there always needs to be constant tweaks and 
            updates to keep it running smoothly, that’s generally the role of a 
            database specialist, which luckily for us at SOMMI we have Shanice who 
            in the future would like to be a database specialist! We would need someone
            that is great at analytics and Shanice has mentioned previously how that is 
            a specialty she possesses. A major risk to every app is errors occurring or 
            bugs appearing that take gives the user a poor experience, a database specialist
            will make sure that they find bugs before they arise by constantly test the program,
            almost trying to make it crash. For an app as large as Mealr with be with its inventory
            Shanice’s role will be a critical one. 
            <p>Whilst the above roles are those that the team will eventually undertake when work 
            on Mealr begins, the team dynamic within assignment 3 will need to vary slightly given 
            that most of the team do not have the experience to do these roles.</p>
            <p>As previously mentioned, <strong>Mitchell</strong> has taken on the role of team leader and 
            as such has undertaken a role like that of the Lead Developer; his role in this 
            assignment will be to mentor the other team members, plan and document the 
            technical aspects of the project including the progress of the plans initially 
            raised by Michael.</p>
            <p><strong>Michael</strong>’s role is quite similar to that of a product owner; he has 
            approached the team with an idea and his role within the group is to prepare a 
            project brief or user story that the other team members can understand and need 
            to adhere to. However, user’s stories are not without risk, and this is where 
            Isaac’s role will become important.</p>
            <p><strong>Isaac</strong>’s role within this assignment is manage the project’s risks. This 
            includes anticipating what risks Mealr might face and finding strategies that 
            will allow the team to minimise or negate the risks altogether. Whilst these 
            risks will need to be communicated to all team members involved in the Mealr 
            project, someone within the group who will need to be aware of the risks, and 
            more, to the point of omniscience is Olivia.</p>
            <p>Within assignment 3, <strong>Olivia</strong> will be undertaking the project manager role. 
            Whilst this role is similar to that of a lead developer, the role differs in 
            that it is less technically and is more concerned with ensuring that project 
            deadlines are met. Olivia’s key role within the project is to maintain due 
            dates, meeting notes and finalise documentation.</p>
            <p>Finally, <strong>Shanice</strong> will be undertaking the role of the user interface designer.
            Shanice’s role within the team is to ensure that Mealr has an attractive user 
            interface and provides a positive experience for Mealr users. This includes testing 
            to the user interface to ensure that it is user-friendly and providing the Mealr 
            investors with a broad idea of what to expect when the application is finally 
            released.</p>
            <p>All of these roles play a critical part in the creation
            of Mealr, every single member would need to play their part as if anyone doesn’t then this 
            application would never work correctly. Thankfully we in SOMMI work great together, therefore 
            Mealr has a very bright future!
          </p>
          <h4>Scope and Limitations</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>Overview</strong>
            <br>SOMMI have decided to develop an application called Mealr. This 
            application will be available as a mobile application; for both iOS and 
            Android devices; and as a web application for larger devices The purpose of the 
            application is to provide end users with a range of recipes that can be 
            filtered based on dietary requirements and preferences.  
            <br>In the future, the application will also provide end users with the ability 
            to create a shopping cart that is linked directly to their preferred supermarket 
            chain and location.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Initial Scope</strong>
            <br>The largest part of realising this project is the building of 
            the application itself. However, due to fact that the team does not possess 
            the required skills to build an application, the team have chosen to focus on 
            developing and presenting the user interface and user experience. This allows 
            the team to present the overall idea to a group of investors.
            <br>Within the time provided the team aims to refine the overall application’s 
            aesthetic and build a shell for the web application based on the colour 
            scheme chosen (see below). The consistency across both the web and mobile 
            applications means that end users have a seamless experience regardless of 
            their chosen device, or if the end user is switching between devices.  
            <br><br>[insert image of colour scheme used]
            <br><br>From there, the team plans to present a user story based on what the team 
            believes the minimum viable product (hereafter MVP) of the application should entail. 
            <br>If there is additional time, the team plan to expand on the user story and 
            include additional features such as the vertical supermarket integration and recipe 
            budgeting.  
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Priorities</strong>
            <br>The main priority leading up to the 21st of November deadline is to refine 
            the application’s user interface. The idea is to study similar applications and
             what the team believe they do well and what needs to be improved upon.  
            <br>The second priority is building a simple user experience that details the 
            users end to end experience when using the application on their mobile device 
            given that the team believe most of the applications usage will come from 
            users whilst they are shopping or “on the go.”  
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Limitations</strong>
            <br>There are two main limitations that the team have identified: time and skill.  
            <br>Time is a large factor because many of the students within the group are 
            either studying other subjects or work full time. This means that the overall 
            resource time that can be allocated to the project is limited.
            <br>Another factor that limits the team's ability to produce a functioning 
            product is the team’s current inability to program. Whilst everyone in the 
            team understands the basics of HTML because of assignment 1, and most of the 
            group understands the basics of programming; this is not enough of an 
            understanding to build a fully functioning application. As mentioned in 
            assignment 2, whilst it is important to understand and be able to code in HTML, 
            CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript, the team also requires the 
            ability to develop within an operating system’s (hereafter OS) specific 
            environment such as XCode for iOS and be able to write in an operating system’s 
            specific language, such as Swift for iOS; to ensure that the mobile or web 
            application performs optimally.  
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Future Features</strong>
            <br>As previously mentioned, the minimum viable product for Mealr is the 
            overall ability to search for and upload recipes based on an end user’s 
            dietary requirements. Future iterations of the application will feature the 
            ability to create shopping carts that automatically scale ingredient 
            requirements based on the number of servings required and will utilise 
            vertical integration with supermarket chains such as Coles and Woolworths to 
            provide end users with the ability to shop within the application.
            <br><br>[insert image of roadmap]

          </p>
          <h4>Motivation and Point of Difference</h4>
          <p>
            We are very interested in Mealr as several of us have previously, or
            currently still do subscribe to meal kit services however, these
            meal kits are somewhat limited when it comes to dietary requirements
            for the recipes that are produced each week. The most popular meal
            kit services such as Hello Fresh, Dinnerly, and Marley Spoon do
            offer meals and ingredients that are vegetarian and contain no added
            gluten however there are not as many of these meals compared to the
            meals offered that contain meat or gluten (Marley Spoon, 2021).
            Further to this, many people do also have requirements of consuming
            only halal or kosher certified foods. The ingredients provided in
            these meal kits often don’t state whether they are halal or kosher
            certified and may cause apprehension for people with this
            requirement. Meal kit services are also not as readily available for
            people who do adhere to halal and kosher requirements. The only
            halal or kosher meal kits available in Melbourne are Halal Dinnerbox
            and Kosher Meals on Wheels, both of which only provide their
            customers with pre-packaged and precooked food, limiting the
            customer on being able to enjoy freshly cooked meals. If a user
            lives far away from a large city, then the likelihood of there being
            such service that can deliver to them is very slim.
          </p>
          <p>
            The point of difference for Mealr is to allow users with very
            specific dietary requirements to enjoy the convenience of meal
            planning and not having to think about if the food they are making
            is okay to consume, while also enjoying their meals being as fresh
            as possible since they are not pre-packaged. Mealr also allows users
            to save the cost of delivery if they wish to go to their supermarket
            or local food store to purchase their ingredients. The price of
            delivery for meal kits such as Dinnerly, Marley Spoon, and Hello
            Fresh is $10.00 per box sent (Marley Spoon, 2021). If a user
            received a box each week, this is an additional $520.00 over the
            course of a year, which can easily be saved if the user wishes.
          </p>
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
          <p>
            Supermarkets such as Coles and Woolworths also have a similar
            product on their website, which allows users to shop recipes and add
            the items required to their shopping list and predict the total cost
            of the meal. Mealr will differ to this by taking it an extra step
            further and ensure that the products that are a part of the recipe
            match the dietary requirement selected by the user. If a user is
            strictly vegan, then only products that are 100% vegan will be shown
            on their shopping list. This point of different will allow users of
            Mealr to not have to investigate the ingredient list of every item
            they buy, saving the user time and potential headaches.
            <p id="How will it work?"></p>

          </p>
          <h4>How will it work?</h4>
          <p>
            Mealr will work by being a database that stores recipes that are
            released on a weekly basis. The recipes that will appear on Mealr
            are produced by chefs and by users that have an account and wish to
            submit recipes they would like to share. Each recipe that is sent in
            by a user will be analysed and considered to ensure that only
            quality ingredients are being sent in. The users of Mealr can browse
            the recipes that are released by applying filters based on the
            dietary requirements that apply to them. Multiple filters can also
            be selected at once. The filters will include the following:
            vegetarian, vegan, shellfish-free, dairy-free, nut-free, nut-free,
            gluten-free, halal, and kosher.
          </p>
          <p>
            After the user selects the appropriate filter or filters, Mealr will
            then show the recipes that match the selected filter or filters.
            Each week there will be ten recipes for each filter that are
            released to ensure that all users of the app are given a variety of
            options to choose. It’s often a pain point that there are not enough
            options presented to people with specific dietary requirements in
            popular meal kits, so it’s important to provide an equal number of
            options for all users of the application.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once the user has selected the recipes they wish to cook for that
            week, users will be asked how many portions they intend to prepare
            for each meal. If a user wishes to cook for a family of four, then
            four portions will be selected for each recipe. After this is
            established, users of Mealr will be asked what common household
            cooking ingredients they have, such as garlic, salt, sugar, oil,
            eggs, and soy sauce. The reason for this is to remove these items
            from the user’s generated shopping list so when it is produced, they
            only need to buy the ingredients that they don’t have. Once this has
            been done, the user will be presented with their shopping list for
            the week, and it will include the specific products they need to
            purchase based on their dietary requirements. If a customer has
            selected vegan as their dietary requirement, then the products
            listed will only be 100% vegan, so the user will not need to read
            through the ingredient list to confirm this. This will save time for
            users that do then whenever they shop for new food items.
          </p>
          <p>
            The next page on Mealr will present the user with the projected cost
            for their weekly shop depending on which store they would like to
            purchase their food items. The page will show all major supermarkets
            and food stores with the estimated price so that the user can make
            an informed decision on where they would like to shop. If the user
            would like to save money, they can shop at the store that has their
            items for the cheapest price, or if the customer would like to
            support smaller local food stores, then they can prepare what they
            will need to pay. This page will also present users with the option
            of getting the best deal if they are open to do their weekly shop at
            more than one store. This will work by Mealr searching for the
            cheapest required food items and preparing multiple shopping lists
            based on the supermarkets that sell them at the cheapest price. For
            example, if 80% of the required weekly food items are cheapest at
            Supermarket A, and the remaining 20% are cheapest at supermarket B,
            then two shopping lists will be produced. Shopping list 1 will
            include all items to buy at Supermarket A, and shopping list 2 will
            include all items to purchase as Supermarket B. It is not uncommon
            for more than one supermarket to be within walking distance of
            another supermarket or food store, so if cooking meals at the
            cheapest price is a high priority for the user, then they can
            utilise this feature to save the most money they can.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once the users chooses where they wish to shop for their weekly
            groceries, the shopping list is exported to their phone’s notes
            application, via email, via an alternative list-making application,
            or via PDF. It is also hoped that Mealr can partner with
            supermarkets and food stores so that the shopping list can be
            uploaded to their supermarket accounts to allow for their groceries
            to be delivered straight to their door. This will eliminate the need
            for users to manually select the items they need to purchase
            one-by-one which can be a time-consuming task.

          <h4>Skills Required</h4>
          <p>
            To develop Mealr, it would be expected that we have a solid
            understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build Mealr’s website
            and to make it interactive. As Mealr will also be developed into an
            Android and iOS application, it would be expected that we have
            working knowledge of Java and Swift programming languages to develop
            the application on the respective mobile operating system. Since
            both the website and mobile application for Mealr will need to use
            data from the websites of multiple different supermarkets and food
            stores, web scraping technology will need to be used to successfully
            compared the food items and their associated prices (Kenny, 2021).
            Web scraping is the extraction of data from a website which is then
            organised into a user-friendly format (Perez, 2021). Web scraping is
            typically done using programming languages such as Ruby or Python,
            along with a HTML and XML parsing library. A HTML and XML parser is
            software that extracts specific data from webpages and allows this
            data to be navigated and used in an easier to understand graphical
            user interface (MDN Web Docs, 2021). It would be more ideal to have
            a good understanding of Python so that the Beautiful Soup library
            can be utilised to its full potential to analyse products and their
            prices from multiple online webpages. Beautiful Soup is a Python
            library that is commonly used for web scraping (Edpresso, 2021). As
            Mealr will also host a database of recipes and food products,
            knowledge of SQL may be required so that these can be stored and
            added to appropriately.
            <p id="Tools Required"></p>

          </p>
          <h4>Tools Required</h4>
          <p>
            To build the most viable product of Mealr, we will need to develop
            the website and corresponding mobile applications using code
            editors. Visual Studio Code by Microsoft will allow us to develop
            Mealr’s website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and will allow us to
            benefit from the code editors features such as prefilling closing
            tags and viewing features while the website is still in production.
            Other integrated development environments can be used when
            developing Mealr’s mobile applications, such as IntelliJ, XCode, and
            Android Studio. Another integrated development environment, PyCharm,
            will allow us to use web scraping libraries using Python and
            Beautiful Soup. GitHub will also need to be used when developing
            both the website and mobile applications to allow for version
            control when Mealr is being developed. In the emergency case of code
            being lost at any point in time over the development period,
            GitHub’s version control will allow us to recover our work from a
            selected period right before the code was lost. Since we will need
            to use a database to host the recipes and user account data, we may
            require Microsoft SQL server, which is a free program for developers
            to produce the database (Microsoft Corporation, 2019).
            <p id="Funding"></p>

          </p>
          <h4>Funding</h4>
          <p>
            To build Mealr and generate revenue that maintains the application
            and makes a profit, funding needs to be considered. We are proposing
            that Mealr is free for users to use on Mealr’s website and mobile
            application. The free version of Mealr will give users access to
            three recipes each week for each dietary requirement or requirements
            they select. If users are wishing to have access to all ten recipes
            each week for all dietary requirement filters, then the user will
            need to pay a monthly subscription to the Mealr service which will
            cost $11.99 per month. Since it is a paid subscription, users will
            be reminded of the potential savings Mealr can provide such as
            advising of where to do their cheapest shop and allowing users to go
            to the supermarket themselves as opposed to paying delivery for
            weekly meal kit services such as Hello Fresh and Dinnerly. In
            addition to the monthly subscription service, we are hoping that
            supermarkets and food stores are wanting to partner with Mealr, so
            their products are easily viewable on the application, increasing
            that supermarket or food stores sales and attracting new customers
            for them. Mealr will charge these stores a monthly account fee which
            is hoping to be enough money to maintain the mobile applications,
            Mealr website, and pay staff working for Mealr. <br /><br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Prior to this however, the team would need to apply for small
            business grants such as the ‘Small Business Grant VIC’ that provides
            small businesses with up to $30 000 of financial aid. With this
            grant however, it is important to have a market-ready product, fewer
            than 20 employees, be registered with an Australian Business Number
            and the product must ‘increase the overall value and volume of
            exports from City of Melbourne (Australian Government, 2021). An
            alternative to the Small Business Grant VIC is the ‘Social
            Enterprise Grant VIC’. This grant also provides up to $30 000 of
            financial aid but does not require the product to be market ready or
            increase exports within the City of Melbourne. Instead, the grant
            requires that the project will commence “activity promptly upon
            receiving the grant” and be financially viable (Australian
            Government, 2021).
            <p id="Outcome"></p>

          </p>
          <h4>Outcome</h4>
          <p>
            We hope that the production of Mealr will benefit many people who
            would like to combine the weekly task of meal planning and shopping
            list preparation into one. We are hoping that people who may not be
            able to access meal kit subscriptions can benefit from having weekly
            recipes to choose from no matter their dietary requirement nor where
            they live. We are hoping that Mealr can also save users time and
            headache from having to read the ingredients list of every item to
            make sure it’s safe or permitted to consume. It’s hoped that Mealr
            can partner with supermarket and food stores to create a competitive
            market, ultimately benefitting the consumers by their freedom of
            choice.
