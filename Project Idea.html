          <h3>Mealr</h3>
          <br />
          <h4>Brief</h4>
          <p>
            For every great app there needs to be organisation amongst the team designing 
            and creating it, with SOMMI we have stated earlier that our ideal jobs are quite 
            similar. We have future software designers, full stack developers and even a database specialist, 
            this makes it quite difficult to hand out specific roles as many suit that same 
            role. In saying that, it is important we have roles so the creation of this app 
            is successful. As Mitchell has been the group leader so far and his passion is to
            become a software developer it would only makes sense that he would be our lead 
            software developer, making sure the back end of Mealr runs correctly. He has 
            expressed before that he has some experience in coding as well, therefore it 
            would be best for SOMMI to have him as our lead software developer. Now considering
            the amount of code that would need to be constructed it would not be 
            appropriate for Mitchell to do this all on his own, this is where Isaac 
            would step in and help along the way. Isaac has expressed before that he
            would like to become a software developer in the future and Mealr would be 
            the perfect opportunity to work on his skills. The app is being developed for 
            both major smart phone operating systems and will have its own online 
            website, therefore the coding needed to complete Mealr is going to be 
            quite substantial. Isaac and Mitchell will certainly have their hands 
            full for their first programming role, however as Mealr’s creator Michael
            wants to be a senior developer in the future, he could also help them 
            in the coding process. Not only can Michael help code the app, but he 
            can also lead it correctly as Mealr was his vision after all, having 
            this role allows him to be the all-rounder of sorts, making sure the code 
            is correct and leading team members in the correct direction. Michael as the 
            senior developer makes sense as he will make sure the Mealr will become everything
            he wanted it to be and see that it reaches its fullest potential. Michael
            will be helping everywhere as he will know what’s the best direction for Mealr, 
            being the senior developer, he will also help on the front-end and considering 
            Olivia wants to become a full stack developer after university it would make sense 
            that she deals with the front-end coding of Mealr. Full stack developers typically 
            are proficient in both front and back-end coding, we already have two out of the 5 
            people focusing primarily on the back end so its important we have someone to deal with 
            the frontend. Olivia has already shown throughout her work within the 
            group that she is great at being organised, she has made sure that 
            everything is recorded and is there for everybody in the group to see. 
            When dealing with the front-end it is vital that we have Olivia managing 
            it as everything displayed to the user needs to be well presented and 
            organised. With every app there always needs to be constant tweaks and 
            updates to keep it running smoothly, that’s generally the role of a 
            database specialist, which luckily for us at SOMMI we have Shanice who 
            in the future would like to be a database specialist! We would need someone
            that is great at analytics and Shanice has mentioned previously how that is 
            a specialty she possesses. A major risk to every app is errors occurring or 
            bugs appearing that take gives the user a poor experience, a database specialist
            will make sure that they find bugs before they arise by constantly test the program,
            almost trying to make it crash. For an app as large as Mealr with be with its inventory
            Shanice’s role will be a critical one. 
            <p>Whilst the above roles are those that the team will eventually undertake when work 
            on Mealr begins, the team dynamic within assignment 3 will need to vary slightly given 
            that most of the team do not have the experience to do these roles.</p>
            <p>As previously mentioned, <strong>Mitchell</strong> has taken on the role of team leader and 
            as such has undertaken a role like that of the Lead Developer; his role in this 
            assignment will be to mentor the other team members, plan and document the 
            technical aspects of the project including the progress of the plans initially 
            raised by Michael.</p>
            <p><strong>Michael</strong>’s role is quite similar to that of a product owner; he has 
            approached the team with an idea and his role within the group is to prepare a 
            project brief or user story that the other team members can understand and need 
            to adhere to. However, user’s stories are not without risk, and this is where 
            Isaac’s role will become important.</p>
            <p><strong>Isaac</strong>’s role within this assignment is manage the project’s risks. This 
            includes anticipating what risks Mealr might face and finding strategies that 
            will allow the team to minimise or negate the risks altogether. Whilst these 
            risks will need to be communicated to all team members involved in the Mealr 
            project, someone within the group who will need to be aware of the risks, and 
            more, to the point of omniscience is Olivia.</p>
            <p>Within assignment 3, <strong>Olivia</strong> will be undertaking the project manager role. 
            Whilst this role is similar to that of a lead developer, the role differs in 
            that it is less technically and is more concerned with ensuring that project 
            deadlines are met. Olivia’s key role within the project is to maintain due 
            dates, meeting notes and finalise documentation.</p>
            <p>Finally, <strong>Shanice</strong> will be undertaking the role of the user interface designer.
            Shanice’s role within the team is to ensure that Mealr has an attractive user 
            interface and provides a positive experience for Mealr users. This includes testing 
            to the user interface to ensure that it is user-friendly and providing the Mealr 
            investors with a broad idea of what to expect when the application is finally 
            released.</p>
            <p>All of these roles play a critical part in the creation
            of Mealr, every single member would need to play their part as if anyone doesn’t then this 
            application would never work correctly. Thankfully we in SOMMI work great together, therefore 
            Mealr has a very bright future!
          </p>
          <h4>Scope and Limitations</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>Overview</strong>
            <br>SOMMI have decided to develop an application called Mealr. This 
            application will be available as a mobile application; for both iOS and 
            Android devices; and as a web application for larger devices The purpose of the 
            application is to provide end users with a range of recipes that can be 
            filtered based on dietary requirements and preferences.  
            <br>In the future, the application will also provide end users with the ability 
            to create a shopping cart that is linked directly to their preferred supermarket 
            chain and location.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Initial Scope</strong>
            <br>The largest part of realising this project is the building of 
            the application itself. However, due to fact that the team does not possess 
            the required skills to build an application, the team have chosen to focus on 
            developing and presenting the user interface and user experience. This allows 
            the team to present the overall idea to a group of investors.
            <br>Within the time provided the team aims to refine the overall application’s 
            aesthetic and build a shell for the web application based on the colour 
            scheme chosen (see below). The consistency across both the web and mobile 
            applications means that end users have a seamless experience regardless of 
            their chosen device, or if the end user is switching between devices.  
            <br><br>[insert image of colour scheme used]
            <br><br>From there, the team plans to present a user story based on what the team 
            believes the minimum viable product (hereafter MVP) of the application should entail. 
            <br>If there is additional time, the team plan to expand on the user story and 
            include additional features such as the vertical supermarket integration and recipe 
            budgeting.  
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Priorities</strong>
            <br>The main priority leading up to the 21st of November deadline is to refine 
            the application’s user interface. The idea is to study similar applications and
             what the team believe they do well and what needs to be improved upon.  
            <br>The second priority is building a simple user experience that details the 
            users end to end experience when using the application on their mobile device 
            given that the team believe most of the applications usage will come from 
            users whilst they are shopping or “on the go.”  
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Limitations</strong>
            <br>There are two main limitations that the team have identified: time and skill.  
            <br>Time is a large factor because many of the students within the group are 
            either studying other subjects or work full time. This means that the overall 
            resource time that can be allocated to the project is limited.
            <br>Another factor that limits the team's ability to produce a functioning 
            product is the team’s current inability to program. Whilst everyone in the 
            team understands the basics of HTML because of assignment 1, and most of the 
            group understands the basics of programming; this is not enough of an 
            understanding to build a fully functioning application. As mentioned in 
            assignment 2, whilst it is important to understand and be able to code in HTML, 
            CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript, the team also requires the 
            ability to develop within an operating system’s (hereafter OS) specific 
            environment such as XCode for iOS and be able to write in an operating system’s 
            specific language, such as Swift for iOS; to ensure that the mobile or web 
            application performs optimally.  
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Future Features</strong>
            <br>As previously mentioned, the minimum viable product for Mealr is the 
            overall ability to search for and upload recipes based on an end user’s 
            dietary requirements. Future iterations of the application will feature the 
            ability to create shopping carts that automatically scale ingredient 
            requirements based on the number of servings required and will utilise 
            vertical integration with supermarket chains such as Coles and Woolworths to 
            provide end users with the ability to shop within the application.
            <br><br>[insert image of roadmap]
          </p>
          <h4>Motivation and Point of Difference</h4>
          <p>
            We are very interested in Mealr as several of us have previously, or
            currently still do subscribe to meal kit services however, these
            meal kits are somewhat limited when it comes to dietary requirements
            for the recipes that are produced each week. The most popular meal
            kit services such as Hello Fresh, Dinnerly, and Marley Spoon do
            offer meals and ingredients that are vegetarian and contain no added
            gluten however there are not as many of these meals compared to the
            meals offered that contain meat or gluten (Marley Spoon, 2021).
            Further to this, many people do also have requirements of consuming
            only halal or kosher certified foods. The ingredients provided in
            these meal kits often don’t state whether they are halal or kosher
            certified and may cause apprehension for people with this
            requirement. Meal kit services are also not as readily available for
            people who do adhere to halal and kosher requirements. The only
            halal or kosher meal kits available in Melbourne are Halal Dinnerbox
            and Kosher Meals on Wheels, both of which only provide their
            customers with pre-packaged and precooked food, limiting the
            customer on being able to enjoy freshly cooked meals. If a user
            lives far away from a large city, then the likelihood of there being
            such service that can deliver to them is very slim.
          </p>
          <p>
            The point of difference for Mealr is to allow users with very
            specific dietary requirements to enjoy the convenience of meal
            planning and not having to think about if the food they are making
            is okay to consume, while also enjoying their meals being as fresh
            as possible since they are not pre-packaged. Mealr also allows users
            to save the cost of delivery if they wish to go to their supermarket
            or local food store to purchase their ingredients. The price of
            delivery for meal kits such as Dinnerly, Marley Spoon, and Hello
            Fresh is $10.00 per box sent (Marley Spoon, 2021). If a user
            received a box each week, this is an additional $520.00 over the
            course of a year, which can easily be saved if the user wishes.
