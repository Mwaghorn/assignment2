          <h3>Mealr</h3>
          <br />
          <h4>Brief</h4>
          <p>
            Our group’s project idea is an application called Mealr. Mealr can be 
            downloaded onto any iOS or android device, as well as having a companion 
            website, which allows users to organise their weekly meal planning and grocery 
            shopping list all at the same time. Users of the Mealr and its website will be 
            able to select from a range of different recipes that are released weekly by 
            Mealr itself, as well as the users of Mealr. The user will also be able to 
            filter the recipes they wish to cook for that week based on their dietary 
            requirements or preferences. When the recipes for the week have been selected, 
            Mealr will create a shopping list for the user and predict the estimated cost 
            for that week’s meals depending on which supermarket they wish to visit. The 
            aim for Mealr is to eliminate the need for users to think about what they are 
            needing to cook for that week, eliminate the need to think about what they need 
            to buy when creating their shopping list, and eliminating the need to read 
            through each product’s ingredient list to ensure it’s appropriate or safe to 
            cook with depending on the user’s dietary requirements.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4>Motivation and Point of Difference</h4>
          <p>
            We are very interested in Mealr as several of us have previously, or currently 
            still do subscribe to meal kit services however, these meal kits are somewhat 
            limited when it comes to dietary requirements for the recipes that are produced 
            each week. The most popular meal kit services such as Hello Fresh, Dinnerly, and 
            Marley Spoon do offer meals and ingredients that are vegetarian and contain no added 
            gluten however there are not as many of these meals compared to the meals offered 
            that contain meat or gluten (Marley Spoon, 2021). Further to this, many people do 
            also have requirements of consuming only halal or kosher certified foods. The 
            ingredients provided in these meal kits often don’t state whether they are halal or 
            kosher certified and may cause apprehension for people with this requirement. Meal 
            kit services are also not as readily available for people who do adhere to halal and 
            kosher requirements. The only halal or kosher meal kits available in Melbourne are Halal 
            Dinnerbox and Kosher Meals on Wheels, both of which only provide their customers with 
            pre-packaged and precooked food, limiting the customer on being able to enjoy freshly 
            cooked meals. If a user lives far away from a large city, then the likelihood of there 
            being such service that can deliver to them is very slim.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            The point of difference for Mealr is to allow users with very specific dietary 
            requirements to enjoy the convenience of meal planning and not having to think about 
            if the food they are making is okay to consume, while also enjoying their meals being 
            as fresh as possible since they are not pre-packaged. Mealr also allows users to save 
            the cost of delivery if they wish to go to their supermarket or local food store to purchase 
            their ingredients. The price of delivery for meal kits such as Dinnerly, Marley Spoon, 
            and Hello Fresh is $10.00 per box sent (Marley Spoon, 2021). If a user received a box 
            each week, this is an additional $520.00 over the course of a year, which can easily be 
            saved if the user wishes.
          </p>
          <p>Supermarkets such as Coles and Woolworths also have a similar product on their website, 
            which allows users to shop recipes and add the items required to their shopping list and 
            predict the total cost of the meal. Mealr will differ to this by taking it an extra step 
            further and ensure that the products that are a part of the recipe match the dietary 
            requirement selected by the user. If a user is strictly vegan, then only products that are 
            100% vegan will be shown on their shopping list. This point of different will allow users 
            of Mealr to not have to investigate the ingredient list of every item they buy, saving 
            the user time and potential headaches.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4>How will it work?</h4>
          <p>
            Mealr will work by being a database that stores recipes that are released on a weekly basis. 
            The recipes that will appear on Mealr are produced by chefs and by users that have an account 
            and wish to submit recipes they would like to share. Each recipe that is sent in by a user will 
            be analysed and considered to ensure that only quality ingredients are being sent in. The users 
            of Mealr can browse the recipes that are released by applying filters based on the dietary 
            requirements that apply to them. Multiple filters can also be selected at once. The filters will 
            include the following: vegetarian, vegan, shellfish-free, dairy-free, nut-free, nut-free, gluten-free, halal, and kosher.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            After the user selects the appropriate filter or filters, Mealr will then show the 
            recipes that match the selected filter or filters. Each week there will be ten 
            recipes for each filter that are released to ensure that all users of the app are 
            given a variety of options to choose. It’s often a pain point that there are not 
            enough options presented to people with specific dietary requirements in popular 
            meal kits, so it’s important to provide an equal number of options for all users 
            of the application.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Once the user has selected the recipes they wish to cook for that week, users will 
            be asked how many portions they intend to prepare for each meal. If a user wishes 
            to cook for a family of four, then four portions will be selected for each recipe. 
            After this is established, users of Mealr will be asked what common household cooking 
            ingredients they have, such as garlic, salt, sugar, oil, eggs, and soy sauce. The 
            reason for this is to remove these items from the user’s generated shopping list 
            so when it is produced, they only need to buy the ingredients that they don’t have. 
            Once this has been done, the user will be presented with their shopping list for 
            the week, and it will include the specific products they need to purchase based on 
            their dietary requirements. If a customer has selected vegan as their dietary requirement, 
            then the products listed will only be 100% vegan, so the user will not need to read 
            through the ingredient list to confirm this. This will save time for users that do then 
            whenever they shop for new food items.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The next page on Mealr will present the user with the projected cost for their weekly shop 
            depending on which store they would like to purchase their food items. The page will show all 
            major supermarkets and food stores with the estimated price so that the user can make an 
            informed decision on where they would like to shop. If the user would like to save money, 
            they can shop at the store that has their items for the cheapest price, or if the customer 
            would like to support smaller local food stores, then they can prepare what they will need 
            to pay. This page will also present users with the option of getting the best deal if they 
            are open to do their weekly shop at more than one store. This will work by Mealr searching 
            for the cheapest required food items and preparing multiple shopping lists based on the 
            supermarkets that sell them at the cheapest price. For example, if 80% of the required weekly 
            food items are cheapest at Supermarket A, and the remaining 20% are cheapest at supermarket B, 
            then two shopping lists will be produced. Shopping list 1 will include all items to buy at 
            Supermarket A, and shopping list 2 will include all items to purchase as Supermarket B. It is 
            not uncommon for more than one supermarket to be within walking distance of another supermarket 
            or food store, so if cooking meals at the cheapest price is a high priority for the user, then 
            they can utilise this feature to save the most money they can.
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p>
            Once the users chooses where they wish to shop for their weekly groceries, the shopping list is 
            exported to their phone’s notes application, via email, via an alternative list-making application, 
            or via PDF. It is also hoped that Mealr can partner with supermarkets and food stores so that the 
            shopping list can be uploaded to their supermarket accounts to allow for their groceries to be 
            delivered straight to their door. This will eliminate the need for users to manually select the 
            items they need to purchase one-by-one which can be a time-consuming task.
          </p>
          <br/>
          <h4>Skills Required</h4>
          <p>
            To develop Mealr, it would be expected that we have a solid understanding of HTML, CSS, and 
            JavaScript to build Mealr’s website and to make it interactive. As Mealr will also be developed 
            into an Android and iOS application, it would be expected that we have working knowledge of 
            Java and Swift programming languages to develop the application on the respective mobile 
            operating system. Since both the website and mobile application for Mealr will need to use 
            data from the websites of multiple different supermarkets and food stores, web scraping 
            technology will need to be used to successfully compared the food items and their associated 
            prices (Kenny, 2021). Web scraping is the extraction of data from a website which is then 
            organised into a user-friendly format (Perez, 2021). Web scraping is typically done using 
            programming languages such as Ruby or Python, along with a HTML and XML parsing library. A 
            HTML and XML parser is software that extracts specific data from webpages and allows this 
            data to be navigated and used in an easier to understand graphical user interface (MDN Web Docs, 2021). 
            It would be more ideal to have a good understanding of Python so that the Beautiful Soup 
            library can be utilised to its full potential to analyse products and their prices from 
            multiple online webpages. Beautiful Soup is a Python library that is commonly used for web 
            scraping (Edpresso, 2021). As Mealr will also host a database of recipes and food products, 
            knowledge of SQL may be required so that these can be stored and added to appropriately.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4>Tools Required</h4>
          <p>
            To build the most viable product of Mealr, we will need to develop the website and corresponding 
            mobile applications using code editors. Visual Studio Code by Microsoft will allow us to develop 
            Mealr’s website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and will allow us to benefit from the code editors 
            features such as prefilling closing tags and viewing features while the website is still in 
            production. Other integrated development environments can be used when developing Mealr’s 
            mobile applications, such as IntelliJ, XCode, and Android Studio. Another integrated development 
            environment, PyCharm, will allow us to use web scraping libraries using Python and Beautiful Soup. 
            GitHub will also need to be used when developing both the website and mobile applications to 
            allow for version control when Mealr is being developed. In the emergency case of code being 
            lost at any point in time over the development period, GitHub’s version control will allow us 
            to recover our work from a selected period right before the code was lost. Since we will need 
            to use a database to host the recipes and user account data, we may require Microsoft SQL server, 
            which is a free program for developers to produce the database (Microsoft Corporation, 2019).
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4>Funding</h4>
          <p>
            To build Mealr and generate revenue that maintains the application and makes a profit, funding 
            needs to be considered. We are proposing that Mealr is free for users to use on Mealr’s website 
            and mobile application. The free version of Mealr will give users access to three recipes each 
            week for each dietary requirement or requirements they select. If users are wishing to have access 
            to all ten recipes each week for all dietary requirement filters, then the user will need to pay 
            a monthly subscription to the Mealr service which will cost $11.99 per month. Since it is a paid 
            subscription, users will be reminded of the potential savings Mealr can provide such as advising 
            of where to do their cheapest shop and allowing users to go to the supermarket themselves as opposed 
            to paying delivery for weekly meal kit services such as Hello Fresh and Dinnerly. In addition to 
            the monthly subscription service, we are hoping that supermarkets and food stores are wanting to 
            partner with Mealr, so their products are easily viewable on the application, increasing that 
            supermarket or food stores sales and attracting new customers for them. Mealr will charge these 
            stores a monthly account fee which is hoping to be enough money to maintain the mobile applications, 
            Mealr website, and pay staff working for Mealr.
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p>
            Prior to this however, the team would need to apply for small business grants such as the ‘Small 
            Business Grant VIC’ that provides small businesses with up to $30 000 of financial aid. With this 
            grant however, it is important to have a market-ready product, fewer than 20 employees, be registered 
            with an Australian Business Number and the product must ‘increase the overall value and volume of 
            exports from City of Melbourne (Australian Government, 2021). An alternative to the Small Business 
            Grant VIC is the ‘Social Enterprise Grant VIC’. This grant also provides up to $30 000 of financial 
            aid but does not require the product to be market ready or increase exports within the City of 
            Melbourne. Instead, the grant requires that the project will commence “activity promptly upon 
            receiving the grant” and be financially viable (Australian Government, 2021).
          </p>
          <br/>
          <h4>Outcome</h4>
          <p>
            We hope that the production of Mealr will benefit many people who would like to combine the weekly 
            task of meal planning and shopping list preparation into one. We are hoping that people who may not 
            be able to access meal kit subscriptions can benefit from having weekly recipes to choose from no 
            matter their dietary requirement nor where they live. We are hoping that Mealr can also save users 
            time and headache from having to read the ingredients list of every item to make sure it’s safe or 
            permitted to consume. It’s hoped that Mealr can partner with supermarket and food stores to create 
            a competitive market, ultimately benefitting the consumers by their freedom of choice.
