          <h3>Mealr</h3>
          <br />
          <h4>Brief</h4>
          <p>
            For every great app there needs to be organisation amongst the team designing 
            and creating it, with SOMMI we have stated earlier that our ideal jobs are quite 
            similar. We have future software designers, full stack developers and even a database specialist, 
            this makes it quite difficult to hand out specific roles as many suit that same 
            role. In saying that, it is important we have roles so the creation of this app 
            is successful. As Mitchell has been the group leader so far and his passion is to
            become a software developer it would only makes sense that he would be our lead 
            software developer, making sure the back end of Mealr runs correctly. He has 
            expressed before that he has some experience in coding as well, therefore it 
            would be best for SOMMI to have him as our lead software developer. Now considering
            the amount of code that would need to be constructed it would not be 
            appropriate for Mitchell to do this all on his own, this is where Isaac 
            would step in and help along the way. Isaac has expressed before that he
            would like to become a software developer in the future and Mealr would be 
            the perfect opportunity to work on his skills. The app is being developed for 
            both major smart phone operating systems and will have its own online 
            website, therefore the coding needed to complete Mealr is going to be 
            quite substantial. Isaac and Mitchell will certainly have their hands 
            full for their first programming role, however as Mealr’s creator Michael
            wants to be a senior developer in the future, he could also help them 
            in the coding process. Not only can Michael help code the app, but he 
            can also lead it correctly as Mealr was his vision after all, having 
            this role allows him to be the all-rounder of sorts, making sure the code 
            is correct and leading team members in the correct direction. Michael as the 
            senior developer makes sense as he will make sure the Mealr will become everything
            he wanted it to be and see that it reaches its fullest potential. Michael
            will be helping everywhere as he will know what’s the best direction for Mealr, 
            being the senior developer, he will also help on the front-end and considering 
            Olivia wants to become a full stack developer after university it would make sense 
            that she deals with the front-end coding of Mealr. Full stack developers typically 
            are proficient in both front and back-end coding, we already have two out of the 5 
            people focusing primarily on the back end so its important we have someone to deal with 
            the frontend. Olivia has already shown throughout her work within the 
            group that she is great at being organised, she has made sure that 
            everything is recorded and is there for everybody in the group to see. 
            When dealing with the front-end it is vital that we have Olivia managing 
            it as everything displayed to the user needs to be well presented and 
            organised. With every app there always needs to be constant tweaks and 
            updates to keep it running smoothly, that’s generally the role of a 
            database specialist, which luckily for us at SOMMI we have Shanice who 
            in the future would like to be a database specialist! We would need someone
            that is great at analytics and Shanice has mentioned previously how that is 
            a specialty she possesses. A major risk to every app is errors occurring or 
            bugs appearing that take gives the user a poor experience, a database specialist
            will make sure that they find bugs before they arise by constantly test the program,
            almost trying to make it crash. For an app as large as Mealr with be with its inventory
            Shanice’s role will be a critical one. 
          </p>
          <h4>Motivation and Point of Difference</h4>
          <p>
            We are very interested in Mealr as several of us have previously, or
            currently still do subscribe to meal kit services however, these
            meal kits are somewhat limited when it comes to dietary requirements
            for the recipes that are produced each week. The most popular meal
            kit services such as Hello Fresh, Dinnerly, and Marley Spoon do
            offer meals and ingredients that are vegetarian and contain no added
            gluten however there are not as many of these meals compared to the
            meals offered that contain meat or gluten (Marley Spoon, 2021).
            Further to this, many people do also have requirements of consuming
            only halal or kosher certified foods. The ingredients provided in
            these meal kits often don’t state whether they are halal or kosher
            certified and may cause apprehension for people with this
            requirement. Meal kit services are also not as readily available for
            people who do adhere to halal and kosher requirements. The only
            halal or kosher meal kits available in Melbourne are Halal Dinnerbox
            and Kosher Meals on Wheels, both of which only provide their
            customers with pre-packaged and precooked food, limiting the
            customer on being able to enjoy freshly cooked meals. If a user
            lives far away from a large city, then the likelihood of there being
            such service that can deliver to them is very slim.
          </p>
          <p>
            The point of difference for Mealr is to allow users with very
            specific dietary requirements to enjoy the convenience of meal
            planning and not having to think about if the food they are making
            is okay to consume, while also enjoying their meals being as fresh
            as possible since they are not pre-packaged. Mealr also allows users
            to save the cost of delivery if they wish to go to their supermarket
            or local food store to purchase their ingredients. The price of
            delivery for meal kits such as Dinnerly, Marley Spoon, and Hello
            Fresh is $10.00 per box sent (Marley Spoon, 2021). If a user
            received a box each week, this is an additional $520.00 over the
            course of a year, which can easily be saved if the user wishes.
