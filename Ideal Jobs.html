          <h3>Isaac K</h3>
          <p>
            The job I feel would be ideal for me is one I found on seek. The 
            role is as a software developer for ANZ, which in my opinion would 
            be a great place to have a career. The job appeals to me because of 
            the role, I know a few software developers and they always talk highly 
            of the occupation, I also think a company like ANZ is one that would 
            not only have a solid work environment but also a great place to have 
            on a resume. To get this role would not be possible yet as the 
            requirements for this role are quite extensive, you need a minimum of 
            3 years commercial experience developing software in MS C# .NET, I 
            would also need experience with HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript and 
            much more! This role is clearly looking for a very skilled and 
            knowledgeable software developer, at this point I am nowhere close to 
            being an acceptable candidate. I currently only have very basic skills 
            when it comes to IT, I know how to operate all of Microsoft office, I 
            know how to fix basic problems on a computer, I know very little Java 
            and Python apart from that I am not very skilled yet. To be qualified 
            for a job like this I know that it would acquire dedication and hard 
            work, first thing I would need to do is complete this bachelor’s degree 
            as that would be a great step in the right direction, if possible, it 
            would be ideal to have a part time job through university that has a 
            focus on MS #C and HTML5 so I can increase my experience. 
          </p>

          <h3>Michael C</h3>
          <p>
            In an ideal world I would love to become a senior developer. A developer 
            develops, maintains, tests, and deploys software programs. A senior 
            developer is a developer that has at several years of experience and 
            knowledge of a wide array of programming languages and development 
            platforms. Senior developers are also seen as mentors in the field for 
            junior developers as they often guide them and cultivate a culture of 
            success in the team. I aim to become a senior developer by first 
            completing my I.T. degree and working as a junior developer to break 
            into the field and gain experience. 
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>Mitchell W</h3>
          <p>
            Due to my passion for coding and more so the backend of code, my ideal 
            job within the field of IT would be software development or software 
            engineering. Both these jobs require an extensive knowledge of multiple 
            programming. Requirements for these roles almost always need some sort 
            of IT related degree and years of experience in the same field but in 
            a junior position. Employers are often looking for self-motivated people 
            who have an eye for detail and can excel in a collaborative environment.
          </p>

          <h3>Olivia V</h3>
          <p>
            At this point in time my ideal role would be full stack development. 
            The role requires knowledge of front-end development, back-end 
            development and how they interact. To achieve this, I plan to spend 
            some time as a Support Engineer; this allows me to interact with 
            clients and gain an understanding of products. From there, I plan to 
            spend some time in both back-end and front-end development roles.
            <br /> 
            Other roles that I have considered include being a product owner and penetration tester.

          <h3>Shanice P</h3>
          <p>
            My ideal job (at the moment) would be as a database specialist. This 
            role also calls for someone that can communicate well with others 
            and can also self-manage their workload. This role is appealing to 
            me as I’m a very analytic person that loves the idea of working 
            within a database management type career path.
            The way I plan to gain better skills and qualifications to progress 
            towards this career path is to do any free courses/certifications that 
            I can with companies such as Microsoft, Google and Amazon (AWS). I am 
            also looking into starting to do freelance work to broaden my skills 
            within the IT sector (specifically within data input and database management), 
            this will allow me to build up a portfolio of skills/experience while also 
            allowing me to further my communication skills when dealing with a wide 
            variety of people from different sectors.

          <h3>Ideal Job Comparison</h3>
          <p>
            Within the group there are only three different ideal jobs chosen, software 
            developer, full stack developer, and database specialist. Software 
            development and full stack development are very similar as they are both 
            development roles revolving around creating applications with programming 
            languages, however; in a software development role you will be creating, 
            testing, and maintaining an applications back-end which will contain logic 
            and databases, while a full stack developer will primarily by creating 
            front-end UI and back-end logic and databases for web apps or websites. 
            Database specialists design and install database systems for their employers 
            or clients and they can also be a part of the development process of 
            applications which require complex databases to retrieve or display data.
            <br />
            <p>
              <strong>Comparison and Similarities</strong> <br />
              Inherently, all three of the ideal jobs listed in the comparison table 
              have similar requirements and skills needed as they all revolve around 
              the development aspect of information technologies. Where many 
              differences lie is in the duties and tasks for each role. 
              <br /><br />
              When comparing a software developer to a full stack developer the 
              differences between these roles are the tools they are using to develop, 
              the scope of development, and the product of development. A software 
              developer will mostly be using programming languages such as python, 
              objective-c, java, and swift which are used to develop native 
              applications, whereas a full stack developer will be using front-end 
              languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as well as the back-end 
              languages which software developers use such as python, objective-c, 
              java, and swift. Both the software developer and full stack developer 
              rolls will be using IDEs to create their applications and similar 
              collaborative tools when working in a team like GitHub and MS Teams. 
              As for skills, both the software developer and the full stack developer 
              require similar, if not the same skill set. The only difference would be 
              that because of the nature of front-end development, full stack developers 
              will need a form of creativity when developing their websites or webapps.
              <br /><br />
              Comparing a database specialist to a software developer and full stack 
              developer the tools used are different. Rather than using an IDE, database 
              specialists use some different tools such as Microsoft SQL which is a powerful 
              tool used to create, maintain, and access data. Database specialists will also 
              require skills in SQL Scripting to input, retrieve and maintain data within 
              the databases they manage. As for skills required database specialists differ 
              from software developers and full stack developers as a core skill being 
              incredible attention to detail and patience. The duties and tasks involved 
              with being a database specialist differ from those of a software developer 
              or full stack developer as they are not working with applications. Database 
              specialists are to create, maintain, and perform data entry to databases as 
              well as provide security and support the users of the database.
              <br /><br />
              In conclusion, all three of the ideal jobs chosen by our group are very similar 
              in nature with only slight differences in the requirements and skills needed. All 
              these jobs require bachelor’s degrees in IT or a related field, experience with 
              coding, and experience using the relevant applications and tools used in the job. 
              For the skills needed all the jobs require a high attention to detail, the 
              ability to work independently and also collaboratively, and finally incredible 
              problem solving skills, where the differences lie is the duties and tasks 
              involved in the job. Software developers create applications, full stack 
              developers create webapps and websites front-end and back-end, and database 
              specialists create intricate databases.
