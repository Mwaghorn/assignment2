          <h3>Liam Kelly Interview</h3>
          <h4>1. Please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do?</h4>
          <p>
            I'll give you a short answer, my title is the solutions architect, my main function is too assist in clarifying                   customer requirements and trying to convert those into high level designs for our software and then communicating                 those designs to our development teams. I also try to then work with teams too to understand our existing software to             integrate different pieces of functionality that we have and to help review the software that they develop. I also                 communicate functionality to our customer explaining how things work or are supposed work.
          </p>
          <br /><br />
          <h4>2. Please tell us about the industry you work in?</h4>
          <p>
            I work in public transport industry, I work with the company that has created the Myki system, the public transport               ticketing system in China, the Suica card system in Japan, and many other systems in south America.
          </p>
          <h4>3. What other kinds of work do you have to do? </h4>
          <p>
            I do many kinds of work, these include, collecting requirements, documenting designs, functionality communicating,                 design and to deliver system information to the development teams. I sometimes manage those teams as I was a team                 leader up until two years ago, I only managed really one team, I still work with them now however I was more directly             involved with them. Again, I review software, however I feel that we have already covered that!
            </p>
           <h4>4. Who are all the different people you interact with in your work? Please tell us about them. </h4>
           <p>
             So I already mentioned that outside the organisation I deal with the customer representative so usually their                      technical specialists or their architects, sometimes their business representatives that want to describe what sort                of functionality they need, that's kind of on the customer side. On our side I deal with other teams of architects                that we have, who all are working in different areas of our system, I deal with the software team leads and I deal                directly with developers to explain things and to teach them about the functionality and about the new requirements                and designs. I deal with testers to a slightly more limited degree but again clarifying what's expected and what's                the expected behaviour and how they might be able to perform certain test, and how tests tools work or sometime                    occasionally even just helping develop test tools. I also deal with testers and the developers’ testers. Engineering              manager who is responsible for the delivery of the software, the business analysts who are the primary people                      gathering the requirements from the customer. We have a team of software integrators who take our companies software              and then write little bits around the edges to be able to integrate it with customers systems. I deal with the                    project manager just to try to make sure that I understand what their timelines are and what order they want things                delivered in.
          </p>
          <h4>5. Please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals? </h4>
          <p>
            The people that I interacted to perform my function I think I've gone through, the people I haven't mentioned are the             IT support department who have to set up computers and install new software and fix stuff when things are broken.                 There is also the IT department who also managed services that we that we use. Oh the one I didn't mention is we also             deal with occasionally with consultants from various services, an example of this is we use AWS these days, which is               Amazons web servers and so we've had some of their specialists come to talk to us and help explain how we can do                   things, what services that they have that that might allow us to achieve our goals with help from outside of our own               company. A lot of our stuff is going online or going to the cloud or one of the other clouds these days, I also work               with the general IT team. 
          </p>
          <h4>6. What about your interactions with clients or investors? </h4>
          <p>
            I don't deal with investors our company effectively only has one investor these days, it's funny it used to be a                   private company but then it went public many years ago. In fact, it was the highest performing stock on the ASX in                 2000 and then it collapsed, basically it got so bad that we had some external guy helping to pump cash in and he had               to do it so off that eventually they came to agreement that he would basically just take ownership of the company and             buyout all the all of the owners. Now we only have one owner and I have only ever received one email from him, and I               have only ever sent one email from him, so I don't communicate to him very much. I think I mentioned earlier so I deal             with customers on not necessarily daily basis but close enough to understand what they need so we can teach our guy’s             how things are supposed to work and teaching them how our proposed systems are going to work.  I often check in to see             that they've been able to fulfill their requirements and then once we're done explaining to them how it does work,                 they can connect it to their other work.
          </p>
          <h4>7. What aspects of your work do you spend most time on? Please tell us about these.  </h4>
          <p>
            I don't technically know which aspect, all those aspects that I went through before have their part in my workday. I               mean there's requirement gathering and clarification and there's the design work that I try to do I never seem to have             any time to actually do. I don't know to be honest, all of those things that I do are a significant part of it so I’d             probably say that it's ideally, it's supposed to be system design and that's what I would try to base my day on,                   however it just tends to not get as much time as I wish I could give it.
          </p>
          <h4>8. Which aspects of your work do you find most challenging?  </h4>
          <p>
            I can give you a whole list of challenges, I guess it's trying to ensure that what we build is going to do the job                 correctly and be maintainable.
          </p>
          <h4>9. Finally, can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry? </h4>
          <p>
            OK so for me IT is about making things work and there's many ways of doing that, you can make things work                         mechanically, you can make things work acoustically or you can make things work electronically or programmatically,               that's the facet that I know how to do right and that's what I like to do. In a sense the two main areas that I've                 worked in are public transport and in communications so literally things like modems, Ethernet equipment and things               like that. So, what I do right is try to make systems that enable people to do things, so I've written software in                 modems which allows people to communicate from their homes or businesses to anywhere in the world. I've worked for                 another company which did similar stuff, but they were basically satellite modems that you could take out with you                 into the desert and connect with the world. I like to make things work and I like things to be able to communicate. So             that was the communication side where we can do stuff remotely or people can do things remotely or communicate to each             other, but make making things work for example, I've worked on a whole pile of projects over the last 25 years in the             transport side things and ticketing side of things which let people use there's smart cards to go travelling on public             transport. At one point I don't know whether this estimate is still true but there were probably around 80 million                 trips a day that use the system that I work on, which probably allows 1% of the people in the world to take a trip                 each day. It allows them to travel, it allows the transport companies to collect their money which enables them to run             all the services, enables them to understand how people are using their systems. That's nice when you can actually see             people being able to do things because of what you have done by making those ticketing machines and those data                     collecting systems and the reporting all that information. Putting all of those little bits and pieces to work                     together then businesses run, people get to travel, and people communicate, that's what I like!
