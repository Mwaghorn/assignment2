          <h3>Industry Data vs SOMMI</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Industry Data vs SOMMI Job Titles</strong><br />
            Technology is a fast-growing industry, and as the industry grows so
            too do the types of roles that are required and the demand for those
            roles. In the Ideal Jobs section Mitchell noted that there were
            three roles that appeared as part of the group’s personal profiles,
            these include Software Developer which appeared three times; with
            one instance of Senior Software Developer amongst the three, and
            Full Stack Developer and Database Specialist which both appeared
            once each.<br /><br />
            Surprisingly, this is in direct contradiction to with the Burning
            Glass findings where the data indicates that the Full Stack
            Developer role was the most in demand of the three roles with 344
            jobs advertised, followed closely by the Software Developer role
            with 337 jobs advertised. Unfortunately, there is no statistic for
            Database Specialist, however, based on the information available it
            may be safe to extrapolate that the Burning Glass findings for a
            Database Specialist/Administrator role are in line with the group’s
            ideal roles.
          </p>

            <strong>Industry Data vs SOMMI Job Skills</strong><br />
            By further analysing the roles listed by Burning Glass Technologies,
            it becomes apparent that many of the roles listed require at least
            one of two elements. The first is years of experience, this is
            apparent in cases such as the Senior .Net Developer role which; when
            looking at the first 10 roles on LinkedIn to mention tenure;
            required an average of 6.4 years of .Net experience. This figure,
            when compared with the release date of the ‘.Net Framework in 2002
            (Tauqir, 2020)’ almost 19 years ago and its successor ‘.Net Core in
            2016 (Microsoft, 2021)’ is quite high.<br /><br />
            The second is the requirement for either broad knowledge or a
            specialised skill set. The former is demonstrated in the Service
            Desk Analyst role which requires various skills ranging from basic
            customer service to more broad skills such as a knowledge of ‘ITIL
            frameworks, Citrix and Service Now (Seek, n.d)’. On the other hand,
            roles such as the Php Developer role require more nuanced knowledge
            such as the knowledge of the ‘Laravel Framework and jQuery (seek,
            n.d).<br /><br />
            Within the group, the necessary skills identified for the ideal
            roles were quite generic and range from ‘excellent problem-solving
            skills’ and the ‘ability to work independently and collaboratively’
            which was a requirement for all three roles to ‘analytical and
            methodical thinking’ and ‘high attention to detail’ which appeared
            once each for the Software Developer role and Database Specialist
            role respectively. Whilst these skills ranked amongst the top twenty
            ‘in demand skills’ within the Burning Glass data, and it’s important
            for all the skills listed within the Burning Glass data to be
            present in a potential candidate; the top three skills that were not
            present within the group’s required skill set are: writing,
            troubleshooting and planning. This is surprising because the
            planning of solutions, prioritisation of work, troubleshooting and
            documentation of the above plays a prominent part in each of these
            roles. As a result, it is likely that these skills may have been
            omitted from the required skill list because they are aspects of
            tech roles that are often overlooked or thought of as necessary
            evils.<br /><br />
            Another aspect that was overlooked within the group’s required skill
            set are the IT specific skills. As a result, the group’s findings
            could not be compared with the Burning Glass data however, by
            reviewing the data you can easily determine what three IT specific
            skills are important for each role and what skills are an overall
            requirement. For instance, the knowledge of SQL is an IT specific
            skill that is important to the Database Specialist role, whilst the
            knowledge of JavaScript and Java are more likely to be IT specific
            skills required for the Software Developer and Full Stack Developer
            roles. Further to this, the ability to use Microsoft Windows or
            Linux is a requirement for all three roles but is usually determined
            (either) by preference or company requirements.

            <strong>Industry Data vs SOMMI Job Titles - Re-evaluated</strong
            ><br />
            Based on the Burning Glass data, the group’s ideal jobs have not
            changed. However, it is important to note that the Burning Glass
            data is almost three years old and a more recent study by Robert
            Half Technology seems to indicate that the Database Administrator
            role is more in demand, ranking third in the ‘top 10 most in-demand
            jobs for 2021 (White, 2020)’ than the Software Developer and Full
            Stack Developer roles which have been amalgamated and have fallen to
            eight within this list.
