          <h3>Autonomous Vehicles</h3>
          <p>
            An autonomous vehicle, or as they are more commonly referred to as
            ‘driverless cars’, is a vehicle that is able to operate itself and
            perform necessary functions without any human intervention, through
            the ability to sense its surroundings. (TWI Ltd, 2019)
            <br /><br />
            The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) currently defines 6 levels
            of driving automation ranging from Level 0 (fully manual) to Level 5
            (fully autonomous). Currently most Autonomous vehicles fall into
            Level 2 (Partial Driving Automation) due to the regulatory processes
            that allow the vehicles to be on the road, however manufacturers do
            have vehicles that are at a Level 3 (Conditional Driving Automation)
            which are in the process of being introduced into the market.
            (Synopsys, Inc., n.d.)
            <br /><br />
            The latest technology to come from the Autonomous Vehicle field
            would be Tesla designing their own silicon chips to help with their
            artificial intelligence (AI). The AI chip, that they have called D1,
            has been designed to help train the machine-learning algorithm that
            is behind their Autopilot self-driving system. The D1 chip will then
            accelerate the implementation of the self-driving system, bringing
            Tesla closer to their goal of a Full Self-Driving (FSD) vehicle.
            (Knight, 2021)
            <br /><br />
            The current technology used within autonomous vehicles that is
            marketable allows drivers to have a semi-autonomous driving
            experience. Tesla is a really great example of what is actively
            available to the everyday consumer. Their “Autopilot” system enables
            the vehicle to steer, accelerate and brake automatically within its
            lane. It will also suggest things like lane changes, recognise speed
            signs then lower the cruise control to suit, and can also ‘see’
            things such as traffic lights, stop signs and roundabouts. The only
            thing the driver needs to do is interact with the steering wheel
            every 60 seconds, this allows the vehicle to know that the driver is
            still alert and keeping an eye on how it is operating. (Tesla, n.d.)
            <br /><br />
            Within this decade it is anticipated that autonomous vehicles will
            become fully autonomous, in that there will be no need for driver
            interaction for it to continue driving. It is also predicted that
            one in every 10 vehicles on the road will be fully autonomous.
            Autonomous vehicles will also be on a 5G network (or the newest
            version of it) which will allow them to communicate with each
            <br /><br />
            In the near future there will also be driverless taxi/ride share
            services. Currently Waymo has an autonomous ride-hailing service
            called ‘Waymo One’ that is offering fully autonomous rides in the
            East Valley of Phoenix, Arizona. They will be expanding to San
            Francisco as their next area for research and on from there
            <br /><br />
            When looking at the technology behind autonomous vehicles, you can
            see that there are so many different components working together.
            The vehicles are equipped with things such as radar, cameras,
            ultrasound, and radio antennas. All these technologies combined help
            provide the autonomy of the vehicle, while also making it reliable.
            Tesla again is a wonderful example of how these components come
            together to create the self-driving experience. Their “Autopilot”
            system uses eight cameras to provide 360-degree visibility, while
            twelve ultrasonic sensors and a front-facing radar analyse
            <br /><br />
            <strong>What is the likely impact?</strong><br />
            One of the main impacts to come from the development of autonomous
            vehicles will be the increased safety when on the road. As
            autonomous vehicles can sense their environment, recognize
            pedestrians, traffic lanes, signage, and other vehicles, there will
            be a decline in driver-caused accidents. (Polly, 2020)<br />
            The use of autonomous vehicles will also help commuters to save time
            as the commute time can then be used for working, relaxing, reading,
            and accessing entertainment. (Ohio University, 2020)<br />
            Some of the predicted changes to come from autonomous vehicles being
            more readily available are that:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              People will be less likely to own a car (especially if they live
              in a city), as convenient driverless taxi/ride share services will
              be available in a few minutes. This will no longer be there
              (Bowman, 2018)
            </li>
            <li>
              Businesses will be able to utilise this technology when it is
              applied to vans and trucks. They can have a mini shop set up
              inside, maybe a gym, or even a portable office space. These
              services will be convenient for people that are either time poor,
              or people that have limited mobility.
            </li>
            <li>
              People that have limited mobility due to illness, old age, or
              disability will be able to live more independently as driverless
              shuttles will gain the ability to scan their surroundings with
              lasers, cameras, and radar to find the easiest place for a
              passenger to board.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            <br />
            While the introduction of autonomous vehicles will be great for the
            everyday commuter, the following sectors will see the impact from
            this technology the most
            <br />
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Ridesharing/taxi services – with the vehicles becoming autonomous,
              the need for a driver will no longer be there (Bowman, 2018)
            </li>
            <li>
              Petrol stations and convenience stores within them – with more
              electric vehicles being on the road, less people will be fueling
              up with gas, petrol, or diesel. Unless the gas stations can change
              their models to include charging infrastructure, they will see a
              decline in customers. This will then flow onto the convenience
              stores within them as there will be less foot traffic (Bowman,
              2018)
            </li>
            <li>
              Freight industry – self-driving trucks will in turn remove the
              need for truck drivers, leaving many without gainful employment
              and few prospects in different industries (Smith, 2018)
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            <br />
            <strong>How will this affect you?</strong><br />
            In my daily life, I think that owning an autonomous vehicle will
            have a great impact on me. When I am finished with my degree, most
            of the entry-level jobs within the IT sector are based in major
            cities. My partner however does not find living in a city appealing.
            Owning an autonomous vehicle will allow the long commute to be much
            more enjoyable, as using public transport (such as a train) may not
            always suit my work schedule.
            <br /><br />
            This technology will also change the way I drive daily. Instead of
            being filled with anxiety when driving on a freeway or in an
            unfamiliar suburb, I will be able to leave it to the vehicle to
            navigate to the end destination.
            <br /><br />
            When the regulations around ‘driverless cars’ ease in Australia, it
            will also benefit households such as mine where only one person
            drives. With the introduction of driverless autonomous vehicles, my
            partner will then be able to go get the groceries or take the kids
            to a game without the need to rely on other transportation services.
            I will also be able to send my car to the airport to pick up family
            members while I am rushing to get the house ready for their arrival.

          <h3>Machine Learning</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>What does it do?</strong><br />
            Machine learning is the process of computer systems analysing large
            amounts of data to detect patterns so that it can effectively and
            accurately make predictions and perform tasks that it is not
            originally programmed to do so (Heath, 2020). Simply put, machine
            learning teaches computer systems to learn, like how humans learn
            based on experience. The data that machine learning algorithms
            analyse can range from text, numbers, images, sounds, and user input
            behaviour to name a few. Machine learning gives computer systems the
            ability to perform a very large variety of useful tasks that
            traditionally only humans were able to complete, ranging from
            recommending what song you may want to hear next, recognising speech
            patterns to correct typos and grammatical mistakes, and even
            detecting credit card fraud (Daffodil Software, 2017).
            <br /><br />
            Machine learning can be divided into three major categories:
            supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement
            learning. Supervised learning is the most predominant form of
            machine learning, where labelled data is used to train the machine
            learning algorithms to detects patterns and predict outcomes
            effectively (IBM Cloud Education, 2020). This works in a similar way
            to police dogs being trained to differentiate between illicit and
            non-illicit substances after being exposed to a large variety of
            examples. Unsupervised learning on the other hand tasks machine
            learning algorithms with detecting patterns on its own without the
            data itself being labelled. The algorithm will look for any
            connections in the data set and use this to split that data into
            appropriate categories (Burns, 2021). Finally, there is
            reinforcement machine learning, where the algorithm is fed
            instructions or guidelines and then makes its own decisions on how
            to handle tasks based on trial and error. The machine learning
            algorithm attempts many ways to reach its objective and is either
            rewarded or penalised based on whether its attempts help or get in
            the way of reaching the desired outcome (Hao, 2018). This can be
            compared to training a dog tricks by feeding the dog treats when it
            performs the desired task, or withholding treats when it does not.
            Reinforcement machine learning is what allowed Google’s program
            AlphaGo to beat human players in the game of Go (Byford, 2016).
            <br /><br />
            Machine learning has many practical uses today, with virtual
            assistants such as Siri and the Google Assistant being great
            examples. Virtual assistants are applications that complete tasks
            for users by understanding natural voice commands. When a user makes
            a request for the virtual assistant, it sends this voice command to
            a server where not only the words are analysed by machine learning
            algorithms, but also the tone. The words and tone are matched to a
            request that the algorithm thinks you have asked, and then actions
            this request (Gupta, 2020). The machine learning algorithm keeps the
            requests that you have made so that any future voice commands can be
            compared. Over time the more one uses virtual assistants, the more
            natural language samples the algorithm has and the better it is at
            detecting voice patterns, tones, and accents, resulting in the
            virtual assistant learning to understand your voice with greater
            accuracy.
            <br /><br />
            Machine learning has been advancing not only in the technology
            industries, but also the medical and pharmacology industries too.
            Machine learning assist with greater disease prediction by analysing
            not only typical variables such as age, height, weight, and gender,
            but also analyse studies that have been carried out and the
            demographics of patients to make a much more informed prediction for
            any pathologies a patient might experience (Zhydik, 2021). Drug
            research can also benefit from machine learning, by analysing
            datasets with a potential drug’s chemical structure to predict that
            drug’s impact on genes and cell lines to predict possible side
            effects. This will ultimately speed up the time it takes to test for
            a drug’s safety and accelerate the time it takes to bring that drug
            to the market.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>What is the likely impact?</strong><br />
            Developments that will change how much our lives will be impacted by
            machine learning include the adoption of quantum computing and
            robotics (Rose, 2020). Quantum computing utilises quantum mechanics
            to compute an extraordinarily large number of calculations in a much
            shorter time than classical computers (Corporation, 2021). Quantum
            computers are so powerful that if you to find one item in a list of
            one trillion items, and checking each item took 1 microsecond, it
            would take a classical computer approximately one week to execute
            this task, whereas it would take a quantum computer about 1 second
            (IBM, 2021). It’s important to remember that machine learning
            algorithms require a very large amount of data to be able to make
            predictions accurately, so utilising the power of quantum computers
            means that computer systems will be able to make much more accurate
            predictions and estimates in a much faster time frame than if we
            were to rely solely on classical computers.
            <br /><br />
            As machine learning develops even further in the future, it is
            expected that robotics will benefit from this and become responsible
            for even more business activities (Rose, 2020). Robots will be able
            to utilise machine learning algorithms to perform tasks in a faster
            manner and with far greater accuracy than humans, such as analysing
            customer behaviours and insights. Jobs that are likely to be
            impacted by the rise of machine learning and robotics include
            business analyst, hedge fund managers, and lawyers just to name a
            few (Uzialko, 2019). It isn’t expected that this developing
            technology will one day replace thousands of jobs for people working
            in these roles, however it means that it is going to become
            increasingly harder to find these jobs over time.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>How will this affect you?</strong><br />
            The future of machine learning appears to be a mostly positive one,
            as more and more uses for machine learning algorithms will be
            possible. More large companies and start-ups are getting access to
            the power of quantum computing so that more data can be analysed in
            a shorter time, resulting in increased accuracy of learning and
            predictions. The applications that we use on a day-to-day basis such
            as our social media, personal banking, and digital entertainment can
            benefit from this leap in computer power and complex algorithms. Our
            entertainment applications are going to be far greater at
            recommending us shows, movies, and music that we may like based on
            the patterns of millions of other users.
            <br /><br />
            Our online banking is going to detect fraud much more accurately and
            perhaps even allow us to be approved for lending without the need
            for human assessment. This will result in many more aspects of our
            lives being automated than what they are currently, and potentially
            will reduce the amount of human interaction required. The future of
            machine learning may even make entire job roles redundant, shifting
            human work to be less administrative as technology is improving
            enough to replace these tasks.
            <br /><br />
            The access to quantum computing can mean that machine learning can
            be used in much more complex systems such as autonomous vehicles and
            robotics. It’s believed self-driving cars are going to become more
            accessible in the years to come, so that long road trips interstate
            can become easier without having to worry about losing control of
            your car (Elite Data Science, 2021). The future of machine learning
            is exciting to say the least, but we also need to consider that it
            means certain fields of work may no longer be available to some. For
            people that have worked most of their as drivers, public transport
            drivers, bankers, and administrative staff, machine learning may
            result in their job becoming redundant and no longer available
            elsewhere.

          <h3>Arduinos and other Small Computing Devices</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>What are they?</strong><br />
            Arduinos and an open-source electronics platform designed to be
            accessible and to help people learn about programming and how it can
            manipulate computers to perform specific tasks. Arduinos are sold as
            an individual minicomputer or in a bundle which will come with
            different add-on modules such as, motors, LEDs, and buttons. The
            Arduino is controlled by sending messages to the microcontroller on
            the Arduino board. These messages are sent via the Arduino
            programming language and the Arduino Software which is an IDE
            (Arduino – Introduction, 2021).
            <br /><br />
            Arduinos can be used for a various number of small projects designed
            towards beginners, but also has the complexity to be used for larger
            projects and is used by student, hobbyists, professionals, and
            programmers. The open-source nature of the platform allows for its
            users to expand upon what can be done with the devices and a library
            of extensive knowledge has been built which will continue to grow as
            people keep using the Arduino platform.
            <br /><br />
            Arduinos are extremely accessible as they are inexpensive,
            multi-platform, open-source, and simple. According to Arduino’s
            website they sell pre-assembled Arduino modules starting at $50 and
            even cheaper options if you wish to assemble the Arduino by hand.
            The Arduino IDE runs on Windows, MacOS, and Linus operating systems.
            Alternatives to Arduino are mostly limited to only Windows.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>What do they do?</strong><br />
            Arduinos can read inputs and generate outputs. Relatively simple but
            can be used to achieve big results. Inputs such as a light senser, a
            button, a microphone, and even messages in social media. Through the
            Arduino programming language and the Arduino software, these inputs
            can trigger outputs such as turning on a motor, a light, or even
            posting onto social media. These are just simple inputs and outputs,
            but they pave the way to more complicated projects which can be fun
            and even solve problems through innovation. Some of the fun projects
            people have made with Arduino include, an Arduino Piano, a
            fingerprint lock, gaming consoles, and small robots (20 Awesome
            Arduino Projects That You Must Try 2021!, 2021).
            <br /><br />
            Most of the projects made with Arduino are for fun and for learning,
            but there are cases of Arduinos being used to solve real problems
            and automating processes used in the workplace. People have been
            using Arduino and other brands of small computing devices to create
            automated irrigation devices, although on a small scale only,
            specifically in home greenhouses or small vegetable gardens,
            advancements like this have potential to develop into large scale
            improvements. Unfortunately, due to the limited processing power and
            RAM on a small computing device, large scale projects would require
            either many small computing devices or a more powerful solution.
            This limitation is what keeps Arduinos and other small computing
            devices from rapid development. The most common Arduino, the Arduino
            Duo boasts 16MHz of processing power and 2kb of SRAM which compared
            to a modern-day phone is insignificant. This limitation to computing
            power is why Arduinos succeed is automation of smaller tasks as they
            require minimal processing power, and the low cost of the device
            makes the process of automation more accessible.
            <br /><br />
            Moore’s law states that the number of transistors doubles
            approximately every two years in technology. With the growth of
            technology each year we are able to get smaller or more powerful
            microprocessors. In the year 2018 a microprocessor was produced
            which was 0.04mm3, smaller than a grain of rice. The device was
            wireless and even didn’t require a battery to operate. To transmit
            data the device used visible light. (Microcontroller - Wikipedia,
            2021).
            <br /><br />
            <strong>The Impact</strong><br />
            Microcontrollers have a huge impact in automation. Being able to
            automate everyday objects such as your kettle so that it turns on 10
            minutes before you wake up in the morning or generate an email or
            support response on twitter when someone tweets you with their
            problem. Although specifically Arduinos have their biggest impact on
            people who wish to learn about programming and machine code.
            Students who enjoy hands on experience with microcontrollers such as
            Arduino might gain an understanding and even passion for computer
            engineering and due to the accessibility of Arduino its being used
            by schools to teach about robotics and programming in a fun way at
            an early age. Students in the future are going to be more likely to
            have programming skills as a fundamental skill when going through
            school and as automation becomes more prevalent people with
            programming skills and computer engineering skills will be needed
            and companies like Arduino pave the way with their affordable easy
            to learn devices. Almost everything we use today has some sort of
            motherboard or microcontroller. From your kettle to your remote
            controller, if you press a button and it sends an output there is a
            high chance your device uses a microcontroller. In 3 years, as the
            technology improves at a rate of 100% every two years according to
            Moore’s law, we will see microcontrollers that are twice as powerful
            as the ones we have today and for the ones we do have today, they
            will be cheaper and more accessible for small businesses, students
            and hobbyist alike, and with more people using and developing with
            them innovation will occur.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>The effects of microcontrollers on my life</strong><br />
            In my everyday life I am constantly interacting with devices with
            microcontrollers. My toaster, kettle, and tv remotes are a good
            example of these. In my daily life, the improvement within 3 years
            of micro controllers will not be significant. Majority of
            improvements developed will be in speed and for my uses the current
            speed is sufficient. Although, advancements in wireless technologies
            and components which microcontrollers can use will benefit greatly
            from the increases in processing powers. I have a friend with
            diabetes type 1 and with advancements in microcontrollers their
            insulin pump, continuous glucose monitors, and blood glucose metres
            can supply quicker response to unsafe blood glucose levels, and much
            longer battery life for these devices. This results in a safer
            environment for people with type 1 diabetes as they are less likely
            to be worried about charging their devices and worrying about them
            running out of battery after long periods of use. If a myself or
            someone I know was to get into an accident and lost a limb,
            advancements in microcontrollers will make prosthetic limbs more
            accessible and even bring them closer to behaving as a real limb. I
            feel as if microcontrollers are fast enough for the everyday
            consumer and most advancement in the technology will only result in
            convenience rather than life changing features. Majority of
            advancements will be where automation is needed and stronger
            processing power is a must.

          <br>
          <h3>Cybersecurity</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>What Does it Do?</strong><br />
            ‘Cyber-crime has been on the rise for years now and it is not
            showing any signs of slowing down (Meharchandani, 2021)’. With
            information and communication technologies being such a large part
            of our daily lives, it becomes more important than ever to protect
            oneself from the external risks that the digital age presents. ‘In
            Australia, the term 'cybercrime' is used to describe both crimes
            directed at computers or other information communication
            technologies (hereafter known as ICTs) and crimes where computers or
            ICTs are an integral part of an offence (Australian Federal Police,
            n.d).<br /><br />
            Naturally, the antithesis to cyber-crime is cybersecurity. Defined
            as ‘the practice of protecting critical systems and sensitive
            information from digital attacks (IBM n.d),’ cybersecurity was
            developed as the result of instances like the 1988 worm created by
            Robert T. Morris; a graduate from Cornwell University; whose worm
            replicated so aggressively it clogged networks, caused systems to
            crash and inadvertently led to the rise of the computer virus.
            <br /><br />
            With the rise of virus’; regardless of the creator’s intentions;
            came the rise of antivirus software solutions. Early iterations of
            antivirus solutions scanned ‘IT systems and tested them with
            signatures written within a database (Mutune 2021)’ but, by 2007
            these earlier solutions had become antiquated and could no longer
            provide adequate protection from the ever-growing number of malware
            samples and nowadays, it is not enough to simply have a strong
            password, and even the strongest of password policies are
            susceptible to cyber-attacks. Instead, it is important to have a
            good cybersecurity system that consists of multi-layered strategies
            that protect against cyber-crime.<br /><br />
            For example the implentation of an Identity and Access Management
            Systems; is ‘about defining and managing the roles and access
            privileges of individual network entities (Storm 2021) and its aim
            is simple; one digital identity per end user that can be used across
            multiple devices and networks. It achieves this by using tools such
            as Single Sign-On and Multi-Factor Authentication which provide an
            end user with the ability to ‘log into a network once without
            re-entering credentials (IBM n.d). A typical identity and access
            management system is made up of four elements; a directory which is
            used to identify users within the system, the ability to add, modify
            and delete user data as organisational and personal requirements
            change, a system that controls user access and an audit that reports
            on user access. <br /><br />
            Additionally, an organisation could implement a Security Information
            and Event Management system (or SEIM) such as Splunk Enterprise
            Security and IBM’s QRadar. First appearing in 2005 as the successor
            to Security Information Management and Security Event Management
            which had previously been separate entities, these systems help to
            detect suspicious activity by utilising artificial intelligence to
            analyse end user behaviour. In attempting to do so, a typical
            Security Information and Event Management system follows the
            following four steps
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Collection of data</li>
            <li>Normalisation and grouping of data</li>
            <li>Analysis of dta</li>
            <li>Diagnosis of security threats</li>
          </ol>
          <br />
          <p>
            However, these technological innovations have been around for quite
            some time; what about the latest in cybersecurity technology and
            what trends should be expected because of innovation within the
            cybersecurity space? <br /><br />
            The integration of Artificial Intelligence has already been seen
            within cybersecurity, Adaptive Networks are relatively new within
            cybersecurity and ‘remakes a conventional network into a
            programmable infrastructure (Preimesberger 2018). An adaptive
            network uses analytics, automation, and machine learning to guide
            policies and allows the infrastructure within the network to evolve
            into an application programming interface (or API) instead of being
            a standalone entity. As a result of the automation of network tasks,
            such as network monitoring and policy and compliance validation;
            errors within the network that result from human error are
            minimised, allowing the network to be more responsive and anticipate
            bandwidth requirements and potential threats both within an
            organisation and externally. <br /><br />
            Another evolving tool within cybersecurity is Blockchain
            Cybersecurity. IBM defines Blockchain as the ‘shared, immutable
            ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and
            tracking assets in a business network (IBM n.d). When used in a
            decentralized manner the network is owned by a collective group
            which is made up of multiple computers known as nodes, rather than a
            single entity. This means that a hacker cannot gain access to user
            data by simply exploiting a single vulnerability within a system but
            instead, creates a near impenetrable wall that cannot easily be
            accessed. Further on this point, because Blockchain technology is
            immutable it means that data cannot easily be changed, and
            transactions sent within the network or encrypted data sent to other
            networks are safe from tampering.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>What is the Likely Impact?</strong><br />
            Cybersecurity tools implemented in today's day and age, or even
            those in the future are impervious to attacks, or failure.
            Cybersecurity affects everyone; from the newborn child whose parents
            have inevitably posted their photo and full name on social media, to
            the couple that has recently implemented smart technology throughout
            their new home, or the middle-aged mums sharing memes on Facebook or
            even the 90-year-old grandparent learning to use technology so that
            they can stay connected with their loved ones. Everyone is a
            potential target, and the introduction of cybersecurity and
            cybercrime will affect different people in diverse ways. For
            instance, an elderly technology user may be more susceptible to
            scams and financial threats whilst on the other end of the spectrum,
            a teen or young adult may be more susceptible to cyberbullying and
            grooming. The main takeaway is that it is important that each person
            is educated on the risks of cybercrime. <br /><br />
            At the end of the day, social engineering indicates that human error
            is the biggest vulnerability within the cybersecurity space and can
            be divided into two main categories: skilled based and
            decision-based errors. A skill-based error relates to an error that
            has occurred because an end user has completed a task incorrectly.
            On the other hand, a decision-based error refers to a mistake in
            judgement and can further be broken down to rule-based errors and
            knowledgebased errors. The latter refers to an instance where an end
            user does not have the knowledge required to perform an action,
            whilst the former (rule-based errors) ‘relies on basic human
            behaviour psychology and neuroscience (Babati n.d)’ to determine
            patterns in behaviour and exploit these patterns; the most common of
            which are quizzes that ask user’s specific password recovery
            questions such as their first pet, or favourite food.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>How Will This Affect You?</strong><br />
            What can be done to protect myself and my loved ones? The most
            drastic action would be to remove technology which, in today's day
            and age is near impossible. Instead, the best action is education
            and awareness; this can be done both in a user’s personal life and
            in the workplace and can include training on the risks of
            cybercrime, training employees to recognise phishing and social
            engineering attempts and ‘conducting “Live Fire” practice attacks
            (Jones n.d)’ which simulate attacks like a fire drill
